## 1. Stdio MCP Server (uvx/npx)
This is the ephemeral, dependency-managed approach. It is ideal for tools you want to use instantly without worrying about environment setup or long-term maintenance.
- **Communication**: Uses stdin/stdout streams. The client writes JSON-RPC messages into the server's input stream and reads responses from its output stream.
- **Life Cycle**: The client starts the server process when it needs to perform a task and kills it once the task is complete (or after a period of inactivity).
- **Key Advantage**: "Zero-install" experience. Tools like uvx (for Python) or npx (for Node) handle downloading and caching dependencies on the fly.
- **Ideal for**: One-off utility tasks, testing new integrations, or environments where you don't want persistent background processes running.
```
Your App                                                        ← HOST
    └── MCP Client                                              ← CLIENT
            └── spawns subprocess: uvx google-workspace-mcp
                        └── google-workspace-mcp process        ← SERVER
                                    └── calls api.google.com
```

## 2. Self-hosted MCP Server (GitHub clone)
This is the customized, local control approach. You are not just consuming an MCP server; you are maintaining the implementation.

- **Communication**: Identical to Stdio (pipes), but the binary/script is a static file on your disk.
- Life Cycle: Because you control the source, you can configure these servers to persist longer, start on system boot, or be managed by process supervisors like pm2 or systemd.
- Key Advantage: Extensibility. You can modify the server logic to add custom authentication, transform data before it reaches the AI, or combine multiple data sources (e.g., merging internal SQL databases with external Google Workspace data) into a single server.
- Ideal for: Production-grade internal tooling, proprietary data integration, and scenarios where you need to customize how the AI interacts with a specific API.
```
Your App                                                        ← HOST
    └── MCP Client                                              ← CLIENT
            └── spawns subprocess: python server.py
                        └── your cloned/modified process        ← SERVER
                                    └── calls api.google.com
```
Identical to #1 — you just own the server code.

## 3. Remote MCP Server (HTTP)
This is the distributed, cloud-native approach. The server exists as a standalone service accessible via a network, decoupling the AI client from the server’s physical infrastructure.

- Communication: Uses Server-Sent Events (SSE) for a persistent, uni-directional stream of updates from the server to the client, while standard POST requests are sent from the client to the server.
- Life Cycle: The server is always running on a remote infrastructure (e.g., AWS, GCP, or Vercel). The client simply connects to a URL endpoint.
- Key Advantage: Portability and Security. Since the server runs elsewhere, your AI client does not need to handle local runtime dependencies (like Python or Node environments). - It also allows you to restrict access via API keys or OAuth at the network layer before the request even reaches the server logic.
- Ideal for: Shared team infrastructure, large-scale deployments where you don't want to manage local processes, and when you want to provide an MCP server to users without requiring them to host anything themselves.

```
Your App                                                        ← HOST
    └── MCP Client                                              ← CLIENT
            └── HTTP/SSE → https://mcp.googleapis.com
                                └── Google's process            ← SERVER
                                            └── calls api.google.com
```

## 4. The Custom Wrapper: Your Own API via Pydantic AI
This is the "bring your own business logic" architecture. Instead of relying on a third-party server to talk to an external API (like Google), you build the server yourself to expose your own databases, internal APIs, or complex business logic to the AI.

How it works: You write custom Python functions that do exactly what you need—querying your PostgreSQL database, calling a legacy internal SOAP API, or running a complex calculation. You then decorate these functions with @server.tool() using Pydantic AI's FastMCP.

- Best For: * Proprietary Data: Giving your AI agent access to company-specific databases or private APIs.
- Complex Workflows: Creating a single "tool" for the AI that actually executes a 10-step internal process behind the scenes.
- Agentic ecosystems: You can even run Pydantic AI Agents inside the MCP server tools, allowing a client application to trigger a specialized reasoning agent hosted on the server.

Since you are using Pydantic AI, you can leverage the FastMCP class to instantly wrap Python functions into a fully compliant MCP server.

            └── FastMCP Server    ← SERVER (Your custom Pydantic AI server)
